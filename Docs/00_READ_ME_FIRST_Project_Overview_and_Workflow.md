# ClariFi Project: Overview and Documentation Workflow

**Last Updated:** [Insert Current Date]
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Welcome to the ClariFi Project Documentation!

This folder contains all the core planning, specification, and design documents for the ClariFi mobile application. ClariFi is an AI-powered personal finance coach designed to help users, especially newcomers to Canada, simplify budgeting from bank/credit card statements and optimize credit card usage to build strong credit and achieve financial clarity.

The guiding philosophy for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to create a **"Lean, High-Quality, Competitive, and Cost-Efficient Premium MVP."** This means the app must feel polished and deliver significant user value while being built and operated with extreme cost efficiency, particularly regarding recurring API usage.

## 2. Purpose of This Document

This `READ_ME_FIRST` document serves as a guide to the rest of the documentation in this folder. It explains what each key document contains and how they interrelate, providing context for human team members and guidance for AI-powered development tools.

## 3. Folder & Document Structure Overview

The project documentation is organized as follows:

*   **`01_Product_Definition_and_Strategy/`**
    *   **`ClariFi_Product_Vision_and_MVP_Architecture_v1.0.md`**: This is the central Product Requirements Document (PRD) or Product Charter. It outlines the "why" (vision, mission), "who" (target audience), "what" (core value proposition, MVP philosophy, high-level feature list), and the "how (high-level)" (architecture overview, tech stack, cost targets). **Start here for overall project understanding.**

*   **`02_Technical_Specifications/`**
    *   **`ClariFi_MVP_Feature_Specifications_v1.0.md`**: Contains the detailed technical specifications for each of the 10 ClariFi MVP features. Each feature is broken down using a 15-point guideline covering its architecture, database, API, frontend, CRUD, UX flow, security, testing, data management, error handling, NFRs, DFD, cost, dependencies, and alternatives. This is the "what to build technically" for each MVP feature.
    *   **`ClariFi_Post_MVP_Feature_Roadmap_v1.0.md`**: Contains similar detailed technical specifications for features planned after the initial MVP launch, outlining the future vision.

*   **`03_Design_System/`**
    *   **`ClariFi_Style_Guide_v1.0.md`**: Defines the complete visual and interaction design system for ClariFi. This includes the color palette (Clarity Blue, Midnight Ink, Growth Green, etc.), typography, component styling (buttons, cards, inputs with states), icons, spacing system, motion principles, dark mode variants, and accessibility guidelines. This is the "how ClariFi should look and feel." **All UI development must strictly adhere to this guide.**

*   **`04_System_Architecture_Diagrams/`**
    *   **`ClariFi_System_Architecture_MVP_v1.0.svg`**: A visual representation of the ClariFi MVP's system architecture, illustrating key components and their interactions.

*   **`05_UI_UX_Screen_Designs_Per_Feature/`**
    *   This folder will contain detailed textual descriptions of the UI/UX for each MVP feature, broken down by screens and their various states (default, loading, error, etc.). These documents are generated by feeding the AI-powered IDE the relevant technical feature specification (from folder 02) and the complete style guide (from folder 03).
    *   Files will be named `ClariFi_UIUX_Feature_XX_[FeatureName]_v1.0.md`.

*   **`06_LLM_Prompts_Used/`**
    *   This folder contains the exact text of the master prompts used to generate the core documents (architecture, technical specs, style guide, UI/UX screen designs). Useful for reference and iteration.

## 4. Intended Workflow with AI-Powered IDE (e.g., using TaskMaster AI)

This documentation is designed to provide comprehensive context to an AI-powered IDE to assist in prototyping and initial code scaffolding.

**General Workflow:**

1.  **Overall Context:** The AI IDE should first be made aware of (or "read") the documents in folders `01_Product_Definition_and_Strategy`, `03_Design_System`, and `04_System_Architecture_Diagrams` to understand the project's vision, overall architecture, and visual identity.
2.  **Feature-by-Feature Development:** Development should proceed on a feature-by-feature basis.
3.  **For Each MVP Feature (e.g., "User Onboarding & Statement Import"):**
    *   **Input to TaskMaster Tool:**
        *   The detailed technical specification for that specific feature from `02_Technical_Specifications/ClariFi_MVP_Feature_Specifications_v1.0.md`.
        *   The detailed UI/UX screen design description for that specific feature from `05_UI_UX_Screen_Designs_Per_Feature/ClariFi_UIUX_Feature_XX_[FeatureName]_v1.0.md` (once generated).
        *   Reference to the global `03_Design_System/ClariFi_Style_Guide_v1.0.md`.
    *   **TaskMaster Goal:** To break down the feature into actionable development tasks (frontend components, backend API stubs, logic implementation steps) for the AI code generation assistant.
    *   **Input to AI Code/Prototype Generator (e.g., Element AI):**
        *   The tasks generated by TaskMaster.
        *   The detailed UI/UX screen design description for the specific screen/component from `05_UI_UX_Screen_Designs_Per_Feature/`.
        *   The `03_Design_System/ClariFi_Style_Guide_v1.0.md` for styling.
    *   **AI Code Generator Goal:** To generate initial React Native/Expo components, screen structures, basic navigation, and backend (NestJS) module/service/controller stubs.
4.  **Human Review & Refinement:** All AI-generated code and prototypes require thorough review, refinement, and implementation of complex business logic by human developers.

## 5. Key Contacts & Version Control

*   **Product Lead/Vision Holder:** [Your Name/Co-founder's Name]
*   **Documentation Version:** v1.0 (as indicated in filenames)
*   All documents should be kept under version control (e.g., Git).
