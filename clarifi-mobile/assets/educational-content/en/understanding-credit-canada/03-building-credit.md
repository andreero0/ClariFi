# Building Your Credit

Building good credit in Canada is a marathon, not a sprint. This lesson provides practical strategies to establish and strengthen your credit profile, whether you're starting from zero or improving an existing score.

## Starting from Zero Credit

### Step 1: Open a Canadian Bank Account
Before you can build credit, you need a relationship with a Canadian financial institution:

- **Choose a major bank**: RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, or CIBC
- **Open both checking and savings**: Shows financial stability
- **Maintain positive balances**: Avoid overdraft fees
- **Use the account regularly**: Active accounts build banking relationships

### Step 2: Get Your First Credit Product

**Option A: Secured Credit Card**
- Deposit requirement: Usually $500-$5,000
- Your deposit becomes your credit limit
- Lower risk for banks = easier approval
- Reports to credit bureaus just like regular cards

**Best Secured Cards in Canada:**
- Capital One Guaranteed Mastercard
- Home Trust Secured Visa
- Refresh Financial Secured Visa

**Option B: Retail Store Cards**
- Often easier to qualify for
- Lower credit limits initially
- Higher interest rates
- Examples: Canadian Tire Triangle Card, The Bay Card

**Option C: Student Credit Cards**
- Designed for students with no credit
- Lower requirements
- Lower limits
- Examples: BMO SPC CashBack Mastercard, CIBC Aeroplan Card for Students

### Step 3: Use Credit Responsibly
- **Make small purchases**: 1-2 transactions per month
- **Pay in full**: Before the due date every month
- **Keep utilization low**: Under 30% of your limit
- **Be patient**: Results take 3-6 months to appear

## Building Credit with Existing History

### Optimize Your Current Accounts

**Review and Clean Up:**
- Order free credit reports from both Equifax and TransUnion
- Dispute any errors or outdated information
- Ensure all accounts are reporting correctly

**Improve Utilization Ratios:**
- Pay down existing balances
- Request credit limit increases on existing cards
- Split balances across multiple cards if needed

### Strategic Account Additions

**Add Different Types of Credit:**
- If you only have credit cards, consider a small personal loan
- If you only have loans, add a credit card
- Diverse credit mix can boost your score

**Become an Authorized User:**
- Ask family members to add you to their well-managed accounts
- Their positive payment history benefits your credit
- Ensure they have good credit habits

## Advanced Credit Building Strategies

### The 15/3 Rule
- Pay your credit card balance 15 days before the due date
- Pay any remaining balance 3 days before the due date
- Keeps reported balances very low

### Multiple Payment Strategy
- Make 2-3 payments per month instead of one
- Keeps balances low throughout the month
- Reduces the balance reported to credit bureaus

### Credit Limit Management
- Request increases every 6-12 months
- Don't use the increased credit
- Lower utilization ratio improves your score

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Closing Old Accounts
**Why it hurts:** Reduces available credit and shortens credit history
**Better approach:** Keep old accounts open with occasional small purchases

### ❌ Missing Payments
**Why it hurts:** Payment history is 35% of your score
**Better approach:** Set up automatic payments for at least the minimum

### ❌ Maxing Out Credit Cards
**Why it hurts:** High utilization severely impacts your score
**Better approach:** Use less than 30% of available credit

### ❌ Applying for Too Much Credit at Once
**Why it hurts:** Multiple hard inquiries lower your score
**Better approach:** Space applications 3-6 months apart

### ❌ Only Making Minimum Payments
**Why it hurts:** Interest charges compound, creating debt cycle
**Better approach:** Pay full statement balance monthly

## Timeline for Credit Building
