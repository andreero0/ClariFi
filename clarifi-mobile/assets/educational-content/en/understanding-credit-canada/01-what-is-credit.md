# What is Credit?

Credit is a fundamental financial tool that allows you to borrow money or access goods and services with the promise to pay later. Understanding credit is essential for building a strong financial foundation in Canada.

## How Credit Works

When you use credit, you're essentially making an agreement with a lender:

1. **The Lender** provides you with money, goods, or services upfront
2. **You Promise** to pay back the amount borrowed, usually with interest
3. **Terms are Set** for when and how you'll repay the debt

## Types of Credit

### Revolving Credit
- **Credit Cards**: Allows you to borrow up to a certain limit repeatedly
- **Line of Credit**: Similar to credit cards but usually with lower interest rates

### Installment Credit
- **Personal Loans**: Fixed amount borrowed and repaid in regular installments
- **Car Loans**: Secured by the vehicle you're purchasing
- **Mortgages**: Secured by real estate property

## Why Credit Matters in Canada

Building good credit in Canada is crucial because it affects:

- **Loan Approvals**: Banks use your credit history to decide if they'll lend to you
