# Credit Scores Explained

Your credit score is one of the most important numbers in your financial life. In Canada, it determines your ability to access credit and affects the interest rates you'll pay.

## What is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a three-digit number that represents your creditworthiness - how likely you are to repay borrowed money. In Canada, credit scores range from **300 to 900**, with higher scores indicating better credit.

### Credit Score Ranges in Canada

| Score Range | Rating | What it Means |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| 800-900 | Excellent | Access to best rates and terms |
| 720-799 | Very Good | Access to competitive rates |
| 650-719 | Good | Access to most credit products |
| 600-649 | Fair | May face higher rates |
| 300-599 | Poor | Limited credit options |

## How Credit Scores are Calculated

The two main credit bureaus in Canada (Equifax and TransUnion) use slightly different models, but generally consider these factors:

### Payment History (35%)
- **Most Important Factor**: Do you pay your bills on time?
- Late payments, missed payments, and defaults significantly impact your score
- Even one late payment can lower your score by 60-110 points

### Credit Utilization (30%)
- **How much credit you're using** vs. your available limits
- **Ideal ratio**: Keep utilization below 30% of your limit
- **Optimal ratio**: Below 10% for excellent scores
- Example: If your credit limit is $5,000, keep balances below $1,500

### Length of Credit History (15%)
- **How long** you've had credit accounts
- **Age of accounts**: Older accounts boost your score
- **Average account age**: Affects overall score calculation
- Don't close old accounts unnecessarily

### Types of Credit (10%)
- **Credit mix**: Having different types shows you can manage various credit
- Examples: Credit cards, car loans, mortgage, line of credit
- Not essential to have all types, but diversity can help

### New Credit Inquiries (10%)
- **Hard inquiries**: When lenders check your credit for applications
- Too many inquiries in a short time can lower your score
- Multiple inquiries for the same type of loan (like a car loan) within 14-45 days count as one

📈 **Keep old accounts open** to maintain credit history length  
📈 **Use different types of credit** responsibly  
📈 **Pay off collection accounts** if you have any  
📈 **Dispute errors** on your credit report  

### Long-term building (1+ years)

## Common Credit Score Myths

❌ **Myth**: Checking your credit score hurts it  
✅ **Truth**: Only hard inquiries from lenders affect your score

❌ **Myth**: Closing credit cards improves your score  
✅ **Truth**: Closing cards can hurt your score by reducing available credit

❌ **Myth**: Carrying a small balance helps your score  
✅ **Truth**: Paying in full each month is best

❌ **Myth**: Income affects your credit score  
✅ **Truth**: Income is not a factor in credit score calculation

## Credit Score vs. Credit Report

**Credit Score**: A number representing your creditworthiness
**Credit Report**: Detailed information about your credit accounts and payment history

Both are important, but your credit report contains the detailed information that generates your score.

## Special Considerations for Newcomers

### Building Credit from Zero
- **Secured credit cards**: Deposit required, good for establishing history
- **Become an authorized user**: Ask family/friends to add you to their account
- **Newcomer programs**: Some banks offer special programs for new Canadians

### Timeline Expectations
- **3-6 months**: First credit score appears
- **6-12 months**: Score stabilizes with consistent use
- **12-24 months**: Can qualify for better products and rates
