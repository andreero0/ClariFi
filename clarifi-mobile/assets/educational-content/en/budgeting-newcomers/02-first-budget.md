# Creating Your First Budget in Canada

Welcome to your budgeting journey! Creating your first budget is one of the most empowering financial skills you can develop as a newcomer to Canada.

## What is a Budget?

A budget is simply a plan for your money. It helps you:
- Track where your money comes from (income)
- Decide where your money goes (expenses)
- Plan for both needs and wants
- Build savings for your goals

## The 50/30/20 Rule - A Simple Start

This popular budgeting method divides your after-tax income into three categories:

### üè† 50% - Needs (Essential Expenses)
- Rent or mortgage payments
- Groceries and household items
- Transportation (transit, car payments, insurance)
- Utilities (electricity, gas, internet, phone)
- Minimum debt payments
- Basic clothing

### üéØ 30% - Wants (Lifestyle Expenses)
- Dining out and entertainment
- Hobbies and recreation
- Streaming services and subscriptions
- Non-essential shopping
- Travel and vacations

### üí∞ 20% - Savings and Extra Debt Payments
- Emergency fund (aim for 3-6 months of expenses)
